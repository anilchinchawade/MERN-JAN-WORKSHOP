    <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
    <p>
      In college, Farhan and Raju form a great bond with Rancho due to his
      positive and refreshing outlook to life. Years later, a bet gives them a
      chance to look for their long-lost friend whose existence seems rather
      elusive.

    <h3>Anand</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) struggles with his patients'
      suffering and the darkness and poverty he confronts daily in his native
      India. He treats a cancer patient, Anand Saigal (Rajesh Khanna), who upon
      learning of his impending death determines to use the time he has left to
      the absolute fullest. Bannarjee's experience with the patient leaves a
      profound impression on him, and so he writes a heartrending bestseller
      based on recorded interviews with Anand.

    <h3>Rang De Basanti</h3>
    <p>
      After a group of friends graduate from Delhi University, they listlessly
      haunt their old campus, until a British filmmaker (Alice Patten) casts
      them in a film she's making about freedom fighters under British rule.
      Although the group is largely apolitical, the tragic death of a friend
      owing to local government corruption awakens their patriotism. Inspired by
      the freedom fighters they represent in the film, the friends collectively
      decide to avenge the killing.
